LGFormer is a hierarchical transformer-based model, based on superpixels, designed for sophisticated image segmentation tasks, effectively bridging the granularity of part segmentation with the comprehensive scope of object segmentation. This repository contains the official implementation of LGFormer, which is introduced in the paper:

- Part semantics emerge from superpixel visualization, even without supervision.
- Superpixels naturally discover part semantics, making them ideal for capturing fine-grained representations.

## Motivation
Fixed patches, as traditionally used in image transformers, often lead to broken and non-semantic representations of objects. In contrast, flexible superpixels offer a more meaningful representation of image parts, enabling finer granularity and better overall understanding. Superpixels naturally discover part semantics without the need for annotations.

- Patch Tokens â‰  Semantic Tokens  
- Superpixels are better part representations.

## Bidirectional Hierarchical Design and Pipeline
LGFormer uses a bidirectional design that aggregates features from local to global contexts in the forward pass and recovers predictions from coarse to fine in the backward pass. This hierarchical representation moves from pixels to superpixels to groups, efficiently balancing fine-grained segmentation with global context understanding. The pipeline follows a dual-branch structure, where one branch focuses on part tokens and the other on group tokens.

## Supervised Results
LGFormer outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in both part and object segmentation tasks, while requiring significantly less computational resources. This efficiency is achieved through the use of superpixels and hierarchical aggregation.

## Unsupervised Results
Quantitive Evaluation of Unsupervised Superpixels and Groups:
Employing 6 superpixels for part segmentation and 10 groups for object segmentation in an unsupervised setting yielded mIoU scores comparable to those achieved with supervised methods.
